1. What is Cloud Computing ?
- Cloud Computing enables convinient ,remote, On-Demand Access to a shared pool of computing resources and services
- On-Demand Delivery of IT resources over internet (internet not true with inpremises clouds) with pay-as-you-go pricing
- AWS Def
    CC is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-gp pricing. Instead of buying,owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services sa computing power,storage and databases on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS
- NIST Def (National institure of standards and tech)
    CC is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convinent , on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or servie provider interaction, this cloud model is composed of five essential characterstics,three servie models, and four deployment models
essential char :
- on-demand
-broad network access
-resource
-rapid elasticity
-measured service
service models :
-software SAAS
-Platform PAAS
-Infra IAAS
deployment models :
private
community
public
hybrid

2. Essential Characterstics :

- on-demand self-service: ability to create IT resources sa compute,storage urslef without need to interact with other humans to do the work

- broad network access: Cloud resources are avail to us over a network and are accessible through standard protocols

- resource pooling: The cloud resources are avail to us over a network and accessible through stand protocols.

- rapid elasticity: Enables allocate and release the resources according to need so that no resource is idol

- measured service: The cloud providers has automated systems to provide transparent billing details about the cloud resources you are consuming
Allowing you , as the customer to have monitoring and reporting capabilities of the Cloud Resources
