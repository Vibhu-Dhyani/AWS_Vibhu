1. What is Cloud Computing ?
- Cloud Computing enables convinient ,remote, On-Demand Access to a shared pool of computing resources and services
- On-Demand Delivery of IT resources over internet (internet not true with inpremises clouds) with pay-as-you-go pricing
- AWS Def
    CC is the on-demand delivery of IT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-gp pricing. Instead of buying,owning and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services sa computing power,storage and databases on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like AWS
- NIST Def (National institure of standards and tech)
    CC is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convinent , on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or servie provider interaction, this cloud model is composed of five essential characterstics,three servie models, and four deployment models
essential char :
- on-demand
-broad network access
-resource
-rapid elasticity
-measured service
service models :
-software SAAS
-Platform PAAS
-Infra IAAS
deployment models :
private
community
public
hybrid

2. Essential Characterstics :

- on-demand self-service: ability to create IT resources sa compute,storage urslef without need to interact with other humans to do the work

- broad network access: Cloud resources are avail to us over a network and are accessible through standard protocols

- resource pooling: The cloud resources are avail to us over a network and accessible through stand protocols.

- rapid elasticity: Enables allocate and release the resources according to need so that no resource is idol

- measured service: The cloud providers has automated systems to provide transparent billing details about the cloud resources you are consuming
Allowing you , as the customer to have monitoring and reporting capabilities of the Cloud Resources


3. Deployment Models :
- private : 
Cloud infra is provisioned for exclusive use by a single org comprising multiple consumers. IT may be owned, managed, and operated by the org, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises

- community :
Infra is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns. It may be owned,managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combinatino of them , and it may exist on or off premises.

- public :
Infra is provisioned for use by general public . It may be owned,managed and operated by a business, academic or govt org, or some combination of them. IT exists on the premises of the cloud provider

- hybrid :
Infra is composistion of 2 or more distinct cloud infra that remain unique entities but are bound together by standartd or proprietry tech that enables data and application protability.
eg load balancing between clouds

4. Service Models :
-software SAAS :
capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on the cloud infra. the applicaitons are acccesbble from varios client's devices through either thin client interface sa web browser or program interface
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infra including networ , servers , od storage or even individual application apibilities , with possible exception of limited userspecific application configuration settings
AWS- provides you with a complete product that is run and managed by service provider in most cases people referring to as SaaS are referring to end-user applications (sa web based mail). With SaaS offering , you dont have to think about how the service is maintined or how the underlying infra is managed

you onlu need to think about how you will use that particular software

-Platform PAAS :
The capibiity provided to the customer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructre consumer-created using programming languages, libraries, services and tools supported by the provider
The consumer does not manage or control the underlyting cloud infrastrcuture including network, servers,,OS or storage but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment
AWS - removes the need for you to manage underlying infrastructure (Hardware and OS) and allows you to focus on deployment and management of your applications.This helps you be more efficient as you dont need to worry about resource allocation and maintainence .

-Infra IAAS :
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing,storage , networks and other funcdamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications
The consumer does not manager or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage and deployed applications and possibly limited control of select networking components(eg host firewalls)

AWS- IaaS contains building blocks of cloud IT. it typically provides access to netowrking features,computers and data storage
IaaS gives highest level of flexiblity and management control over you IT resources
It is the most similar to the existing IT resources with which many IT departments and developers are fiamiliar
